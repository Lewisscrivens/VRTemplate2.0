# Introduction 

This is my Final year project for my university course. The project is research into the development of a 
VR based template project with physics based interactions within Unreal Engine. Also how this template can be 
used to then create a game, demo etc.

NOTE: 

After working on my last virtual reality project I now have a good understanding of what to do and what not to do 
when it comes to working with VR in Unreal Engine. This time I aim to get everything functioning through Unreal Engines
physics engine as the problem in the last VR Template was that there were too many edge cases when it came to grabbing thing
with collisions that are attached to other things etc. So my plan is to use joints, driven animations and other techniques
that I beleive will be a better overall experience.

# Build and Test

To build or test this project for the best results use Unreal Engine 4.23.0 and Visual Studio 2017.
