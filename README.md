# VRTemplate 2.0

Overview:

An improvement on the hand and player classes from version one of my virtual reality template found at the following link:

https://github.com/Lewisscrivens/VRTemplate

I also removed/improved code where nessasary such as the rotatable class supporting a wider range of different movements and the grabbable class 
which has been simplified to only use physics grabbing as the hand was changed to be physics based also.

NOTE: The template was developed using Unreal Engine 4.25 with the Valve index and SteamVR.
